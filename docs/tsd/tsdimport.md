Once the import has finished, you can access your files in TSD from the main data folder. 

## Accessing files in TSD
Depending on which Virtual Machine (VM) you are logged in, the path and browsing interface differs a bit. 
### Linux (p96-rhel8-01-pool): 
The path to the file import folder is `/tsd/p96/data/durable/file-import/p96-member-group`. To access it, open the file browser from the `Places` toolbar menu and either navigate from the root folder or type in the navigation bar by holding the control (ctrl) key and typing l (ctrl + l).

To avoid doing these steps each time, it is advisable to create a bookmark for the folder. To do this, navigate to `/tsd/p96/data/durable/file-import`, locate the *p96-member-group* folder icon, click and drag it to the left pane, just bellow the default system bookmarks, until a green *New bookmark* indicator appears

### Windows (p96-win01-pool)
The path to the file import folder is `N:\durable\file-import\p96-member-group`. You can access it by clicking on the Windows menu, then This PC. The data folder has a shortcut on the left pane. From there browse to *file-import* and *p96-member-group*. You can also mark this folder as a favorite to have direct access.
