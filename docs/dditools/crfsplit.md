# CRF Splitter & Upload Tool User Documentation

The CRF Splitter is an app designed to upload scanned documents related to a patient visit (such as main CRF, MRI report, tests, etc.), split them by detected QR codes, and upload the resulting separate documents to XNAT. 

> ℹ️ The CRF Split & Upload tool only processes the actual scanned document to upload the associated scans to the XNAT subject. This tool doesn't create any experiments and associated data in XNAT


## Step 1: Import the scanned document into TSD
The very first step consists in uploading the file into TSD for it to become available in our servers. See the [user guide](tsdimport.md) for importing files in case of any doubts. 

## Step 2: Access the Application

1. **Navigate** to the DDI Tools web portal by entering `http://p96-podman:8181` in your web browser.
